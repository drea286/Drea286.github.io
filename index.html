             <h3>Andrea's Bio</h3>
            <p>My name is Andrea Tobar, and I am a Technical Communication major, with a minor in Visual Communication Design and Public Relations.  I am 30 years old, I live in Spokane, WA, and I am working my hardest to learn all I can for an exciting future career as a technical writer! </p>
                
            <p>As far as my point of view on designing goes, I feel that, since I have a mind that thinks in technical terms frequently, it is important to know facts about how people scan designs on websites, and why it is proven that most users will not return to a site if it made them feel stupid or tested their patience. With this being said, as far as what I will or won't do in my future designing, I will always design in a way that will orient my user, and have content that is concise and easily scannable.  I will not bore the user or make them feel like they have no control or understanding of my design. </p>
            
            <h3>Andrea's Professional Objectives</h3>
            <p>I am searching for a specific and interesting career opportunity; a career opportunity that can utilize and develop my current education and passion for English and rhetoric, and projects where I can use my technical writing skills in a way that can interact with people and help them to understand or accomplish a task.</p>

		  <b>For this instructions project, I was given a specific electronic
		product that had no known instructional guide, and needed
		one to help people keep their electronic products longer and
		therefore reducing e-waste. The audience for the
		instructions would be any English-speaker across the globe
		that has a Sony Alpha NEX-5N that needs replacement
		parts or other repairs so as to keep their camera longer, and
		that has access to the internet. These documents represent
		skills required for writing effective instructions with proper
		design and style choices. This series of five guides
		demonstrate the different style choices I chose, such as
		proper warning symbols or action verbs. Assessing this
		work shows that I understand the concise nature, active
		voice, and clarity needed to have successful instructions.  </b>

		compelling proposal to show how worthy a project like this
		is for funding. The audience for this project consisted of the
		foundations my group and I found during our database
		searches that had the capacity and the want to fund a
		project exactly like this. This document represents skills

		the current societal issue of stray dogs and cats, and use
		sources for proof of statistics and tested solutions that could
		be effective on a larger scale. The audience for this
		proposal consists of my instructor, although it was critiqued
		as though it was for a much larger audience, such as
		people that are advocates for stray animals. This document
		represents skills required for technically concise writing to
		convey a professional and serious message about stray
		animals. The final product shows the issue of stray cats and
		dogs, and discusses the causes and solutions. It can be
		understood by all English-speaking persons interested in
		this issue if it were to actually be distributed to the public. </b>

		  <b>For this design project, I needed to understand the
		difference between a pixel and a vector image, and how to
		use all the tools in Illustrator to create a vector image that
		resembles a pixel image. Professionals in this industry need
		to create realistic and great-quality vector images that can
		be manipulated in any way and not lose their quality, unlike
		a pixel image. The audience for this project included my
		design classmates and my design instructor who would
		critique my work for my learning benefit. This document
		represents skills required for creating the most life-like
		vector images possible, and achieving realistic looks by
		using different tools available. This document shows the
		different tools I used in different parts of the picture. The
		final product shows how I combined these tools for the best
		possible outcome of a realistic-looking vector image.  </b>

		document represents skills using the tools necessary in
		Photoshop to achieve a smooth, balanced, blended pixel
		image made up from several separate pixel images on a
		backdrop. The final product shows how I achieved the

		groups of content. The audience was only myself and my
